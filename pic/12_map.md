## 2 Designing an Architecture

### Design Strategy

- Decomposition
- Designing to Architecturally Significant Requirements
- Generate and Test (4 questions)
  - Where does initial hypothesis come from?
  - How do I test a hypothesis?
  - How do I generate the next hypothesis?
  - When am I done?

### The Attribute-Driven Design Method

- ADD Inputs
- ADD Outputs

### The Steps of Add

1. **Choose an element** of the system to design.
2. **Identify the ASRs** for the chosen element.
3. **Generate a design solution** for the chosen element.
4. **Inventory remaining requirements** and select the input for the next iteration.
5. Repeat steps 1â€“4 until all the ASRs have been satisfied.
